<h1>A story.</h1>
<p>Hi there, Im Connor</p>
<br>
<p>
So I kinda like this girl.
<br>
She's a little shy.
<br>
Her name is Alyssa.
<br>
I find her smile melts me.
<br>
Its quite disconcerting.
<br>
It makes me feel a bit funny, really.
<br>
as of right now, she doesnt properly know I like her.
<br>
Ive been trying to allude it to her, 
<br>
but im not sure that has worked.
<br>
perhaps oneday, I may show her this.
<br>
should that day come,
<br>
Id like her to know,
<br>
That she is wonderful
<br>
and even should she not want to date me,
<br>
I still respect her,
<br>
And think that she deserves the most joyful life.
<p/>
