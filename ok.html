<h1>A story.</h1>
<p>Hi there, Im Connor</p>
<br>
<p>
So I kinda like this girl.
<br>
She's lovely.
<br>
Her name is Alyssa.
<br>
I find her smile melts me.
<br>
Its quite disconcerting.
<br>
It makes me feel a bit funny, really.
<br>
as of right now, she doesnt properly know I like her.
<br>
Ive been trying to allude it to her, 
<br>
but im not sure that has worked.
<br>
perhaps oneday, I may show her this.
<br>
should that day come,
<br>
Id like her to know,
<br>
That she is wonderful
<br>
and even should she not want to date me,
<br>
I still respect her,
<br>
And think that she deserves the most joyful life.
<p/>

<p>
Although,there may be more to this.
<br>
I have just spent an hour fiddling with just this short amount of text.
<br>
So im gonna leave it here
<br>
and actually try getting further with her
<br>
Im gonna try and ask her...
<br>
For atleast her number
<br>
And I will update this in the future as to the outcome of this quest of mine.
<p/>

<p>
Short update: I was going to ask her out on friday but well. uhm yeah.
<br>
Gonna ask her out tommorow.(Monday)
<p/>
<br>
<p>
Update #2..
<br>
Ahhh dumb emotions. I decided to postpone til wednesday. Its now Wednesday And I still Havent done it. I need to hurry up.
<br>
Fingers Crossed I do it and it goes well
<p/>
<br>
<p>
Now thursday. Still havent done it.
She Unintentionally called me Hot today. It was very Amusing for me and emily.
<br>
I Hope she doesnt leave too quickly so I can just get it over and done with this arvo.
<br>
Why do I do this to myself, I dont know.
<br>
Im always just think about whether or not she likes me,
<br>
And I always think Im gonna do it tommorow.
<br>
I never do.
<br>
It Pisses me off That I dont
<p/>
<br>

<br>
I am a dumbass sometimes.
<p/>

    <br>
    Hopefully I ask her this week. She's away next week.
