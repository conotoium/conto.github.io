<h1>A story.</h1>
<p>
Foreword.
This story may not have had the ending I had hoped for, but perhaps it was an ending I needed.
<br>
To Alyssa, I Understand, and I hope that you find we can both grow from it into a better, healthier relationship.
<br>
Sometimes you need to break the roof to grow a flower.
<br>
This story is dedicated to everyone, with all of their struggles, failures, and successes.
<br>
Sometimes life is difficult, But we can all learn to live from it.
</p>
<p>Hi there, Im Connor</p>
<p>
So I kinda like this girl.
<br>
She's lovely.
<br>
Her name is Alyssa.
<br>
I find her smile melts me.
<br>
Quick afterword: Alyssa you have a wonderful smile, dont let anyone tell you otherwise.
<br>
You may not like me the way I hoped, but Im sure everyone appreciates that smile of yours.
<br>
Its quite disconcerting.
<br>
It makes me feel a bit funny, really.
<br>
as of right now, she doesnt properly know I like her.
<br>
Ive been trying to allude it to her, 
<br>
but im not sure that has worked.
<br>
perhaps oneday, I may show her this.
<br>
should that day come,
<br>
Id like her to know,
<br>
That she is wonderful
<br>
and even should she not want to date me,
<br>
I still respect her,
<br>
And think that she deserves the most joyful life.
<p/>

<p>
Although,there may be more to this.
<br>
I have just spent an hour fiddling with just this short amount of text.
<br>
So im gonna leave it here
<br>
and actually try getting further with her
<br>
And I will update this in the future as to the outcome of this quest of mine.
<p/>

<p>
Short update: I was going to ask her out on friday but well. uhm yeah.
<br>
Gonna ask her out tommorow.(Monday)
<p/>
<br>
<p>
Update #2..
<br>
Ahhh dumb emotions. I decided to postpone til wednesday. Its now Wednesday And I still Havent done it. I need to hurry up.
<br>
Fingers Crossed I do it and it goes well
<p/>
<p>
Now thursday. Still havent done it.
She Unintentionally called me Hot today. It was very Amusing for me and emily.
<br>
I Hope she doesnt leave too quickly so I can just get it over and done with this arvo.
<br>
Why do I do this to myself, I dont know.
<br>
Im always just think about whether or not she likes me,
<br>
And I always think Im gonna do it tommorow.
<br>
I never do.
<br>
It Annoys me That I dont
<p/>
<p>
Friday, She's at Volleyball Parrs. Day feels sooo long.
<br>
I am a dumbass sometimes.
<p/>
  <p>
    Its now june. Week 8
    <br>
    Hopefully I ask her this week. She's away next week.
  </p>
<p>
Final Words.
<br>
This story was a logbook of sorts. It may have been difficult, but it believe it neccesary.
<br>
This story ended with me asking her out.
<br>
As im sure you can tell from the foreword, She said no.
<br>
Maybe it wasnt an ending I had hoped for, 
<br>
But perhaps it was an ending I needed,
<br>
It will change things,
<br>
Of that I Am Sure
<br>
But changes arent always bad things.
<br>
And I guess thats just how life works.
<br>
And to Alyssa,
<br>
I will end with this.
<br>
Maybe what I had hoped wasnt what you had believed.
<br>
But thank you.
<br>
It is through change that we grow,
<br>
Be it for better,
or worse.
<br>
<br>
I Hope this story helped you to change,
<br>
And become the woman we all believe you can be.
